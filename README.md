# ProbabilityLib
C++ Probability Functions Library

Scope:

Provides a general purpose library of probability functions.

Requirements:

PROBLIB_0001  Library shall include a function to calculate the factorial value for integer positive numbers

Note_0001	The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)

PROBLIB_0001_0001	ProbabilityLib shall have a function to calculate the factorial value for integer positive numbers

PROBLIB_0001_0002	Factorial function shall receive INT or DOUBLE numbers as input

PROBLIB_0001_0003	Factorial function shall check if the input value is negative and return the check status 

PROBLIB_0001_0004	Factorial function shall check if the input value is on the right max input limit (i.e. 12 for INT input and 170 for DOUBLE input) and return the check status

PROBLIB_0001_0005	Factorial function shall check if the output value is overflowed and return check status

PROBLIB_0001_0006	Factorial function shall check if the input value is an integer and return check status
